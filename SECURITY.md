# Security Policy

The ScanAPI organization cares deeply about the security of its users and contributors. We are committed to handling security vulnerabilities responsibly to protect the community and the integrity of this project. If you discover a potential security issue, we strongly encourage you to report it privately following the guidelines below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

To report a security vulnerability privately, please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** feature available in the [Security tab of this repository](https://github.com/scanapi/scanapi/security/advisories). This ensures the report is only visible to the maintainers.

## What Happens Next

- The team will review and investigate the report privately.
- If a fix is required, we will work on resolving the issue promptly.
- Once the fix is ready, we will coordinate disclosure and release updates when appropriate.
