## Find an issue to tackle

Ok, it is time to find an issue to tackle! We prepared a dashboard containing all good issues to be tackled during sprint sessions:

Dashboard: https://github.com/orgs/scanapi/projects/9?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen

All issues that are in the `To Do` column and have no one assigned are possible issues for you. Find one that you feel comfortable with.

If you have any questions about any issue, feel free to ask there, we will be more than happy to answer them!

## Issue assignment

Once you have picked one to tackle, go to the issue's page and send a comment saying that you are interested in working on it. This way, we can assign the issue to you.

## Run ScanAPI locally

Ok, it is time to start working. First things first, let's run ScanAPI locally, so you can have the development environment working: [Run ScanAPI locally doc](./Run-ScanAPI-Locally.md).

## Submit your changes for review

Once you have made your changes, it is time to open your pull request: [First-Pull-Request doc](./First-Pull-Request.md)

## Wait for the reviews

Ok, you are all set! You just need to wait for the reviews. Usually there are some back and forth in this phase. Don't worry, it is part of the process! We will interact with you till we have a result that is ready for production.

## All green

What happens when my PR was accepted and all checks are passing? We will merge the PR as soon as possible. So you don't need to do anything else. Congratulations, now you are an official ScanAPI contributor!
