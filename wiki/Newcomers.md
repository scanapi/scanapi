# Newcomers

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Every little bit of help counts! 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♂️

We tried to put together some documentation to help your onboarding. We hope this will walk you through everything that is needed to become a contributor.

If you think any information is missing or not right, we encourage you to [create an issue](https://github.com/scanapi/scanapi/issues) to alert us about it!
